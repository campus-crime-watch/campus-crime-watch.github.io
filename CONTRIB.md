# Contributing

Contributions are **not** welcome, as we are not actively maintaining this site. Repurposing our code and customizing it into sites for other college campuses is very welcome and the goal of this project! 

Here's how you can contribute to Campus Crimewatch without creating a pull request:

## Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at <https://github.com/campus-crime-watch/campus-crime-watch.github.io/issues>.

If you are proposing a feature:

- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.

## Make Your Own!

Ready to create your own Campus Crimewatch? Here's how to set up `campus-crime-watch.github.io` for local development.

1. Fork the `campus-crime-watch.github.io` repo on GitHub.

2. Clone your fork locally and customize our code to your dataset:

   ```
   $ git clone git@github.com:campus-crime-watch/campus-crime-watch.github.io.git
   ```

3. Commit your changes and push your work to your own repo on GitHub:

   ```
   $ git add --all
   $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
   $ git push name-of-your-own-repo

3. Happy coding! Remember that our code must be customized based on your dataset and its formatting. Please add new features that you think would be useful for students and others interested in college crime.
