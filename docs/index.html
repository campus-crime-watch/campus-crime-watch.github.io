          <h2> Student voices </h2>
            <p>
              “You get the emails and crime alerts [and] keep a mental note of these alerts”' Stanford sophomore 
              Matt Villaysack said, when asked how he found out about campus crime. Villaysack isn’t the only 
              student who resonated with the disorganized method of campus safety information. 
            </p>
            <p> Stanford undergrad Ashna Khetan mentioned a similar method of staying up to date: “the alert 
              thing that happens with our email, and if I miss it then I see it on Fizz,” a college community 
              discussion app. For larger scale crimes, Khetan says “we hear about it for a few days.”
            </p>
            <p> 
              Other undergrads recognize that hearing about crime through email alerts keeps incidents and their updates under the radar.
            </p>
            <p class="quote">
              “It can be harmful when people aren’t informed, especially on sexual violence reports that 
              go unacknowledged.”
            </p>
            <p> says Lexi Kupor, another Stanford sophomore. Villaysack agreed with this sentiment, 
              and voiced that as a student living on campus,            
            </p>
            <p class="quote">  
              “It would be useful to see what crimes are likely to happen.”            
            </p>
            <p> 
              After seeing Campus Crimewatch, he shared his thoughts on how it provides an encompassing 
              overview of campus crime:
            </p>
            <p class="quote"> 
              “It's interesting to look at and be aware of, especially if you’re going out for parties and want 
              to know what areas are safe on campus to walk around.”

  <!--Here is the section for our mission statement-->
    <section id="inspoSection">
        <h2> Why we made Campus Crimewatch </h2>
        <p>
          Campus Crimewatch was developed at Stanford University by Isabel Paz Reyes Sieh, Özge Terzioğlu, and Tracy Zhang in Serdar Tumgoren’s Spring 2023 Building News Appplications class. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As students, faculty, or staff of a college campus, we are bombarded with email or text notifications 
          about the latest crimes near or on campus, as mandated by the Clery Act.
        </p>
        <p>
          We want to be informed about crime on campus and feel safe at the place where we spend most of our time. 
          A constant influx of texts and emails is a disorganized, ineffective way of getting an accurate view of campus crime trends. 
        </p>
        <p> 
          Some universities bury their annual crime statistics in a 100-page yearly campus safety report.
          Other universities share their daily crime log via a user-unfriendly map on their school website. 
          It is likely that if you want a daily report of campus crimes, which universities are mandated to maintain, you will have to ask for it and it will be counted as a public records request. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We wanted to create a centralized, accessible picture of crime and safety on college campuses.
