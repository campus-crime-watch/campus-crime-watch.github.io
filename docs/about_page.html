        <h2>How we got the data</h2>
        <p> 
            Every university in the United States, public or private, 
            is mandated by the Clery Act to report crime that occurs near or on its campus.
        </p>
        <p>
          To obtain the daily crime log for your university, you need to call the campus police's records office, the school’s public safety office, or the campus records-keeper and ask for this data.
          They'll likely ask you to put your request in writing via email, but it’s good to call first.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's an example email:
        </p>
        <p>
          Dear <em>Record Keeper’s name,</em>
        </p>
        <p>
         My name is <em>Your Name</em>, and I'm a student at <em>Your University</em>.
         I'm doing a data project about college crime. I am wondering if you can help me get access to the daily campus crime log from the past 5 years at <em>Your University</em>.
         I’m hoping to receive this data as soon as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m specifically looking for:
          <ul>
            <li><em>Your University's</em> daily crime log from the past 5 years </li>
            <li>sent electronically in the form of a spreadsheet, CSV file, or an accessible API</li>
            <li>with the nature of the crime, location, time, and status of the incident</li>
          </ul>
          If the past 5 years are not possible, I would like whatever you can give me from the past 2 to 5 years.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd also like to be CC’d on any messages that you forward on this matter. Please let me know if I can clarify any aspects of my request for you.
          Thank you again for helping me access this data and for your timely response.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sincerely,
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Your Name</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Technically, this counts as a public records request, and the state rules regarding these types of requests will apply. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Before sending your email, research the public records rules in your state and make sure to mention them in the beginning of your email.
          For example, pursuant to <em>government code</em> I am requesting daily crime logs from <em>university</em>.
          Please respond within <em>mandated time</em>, as required by <em>government code</em>.
          If the cost of this request exceeds $50, please notify me. 
        </p>
        <p>
          If they don’t respond or give you incomplete data, keep pushing.
          They are required by law to make this data accessible to anyone who requests it—you don’t have to be a journalist or a professional. 
        </p>
        <p>
          If they give you everything you asked for right away–congratulations!
          Now you can get started on creating this web app for your college campus.
